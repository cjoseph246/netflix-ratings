# netflix-ratings

The purpose of this website is to display new listings on Netflix and any associated Rotten Tomato ratings.  So, if you still
want to watch that rotten tomato movie, it's at your own risk!

The website is the result of scraped data from various websites.  
It is written using Python (Flask, Beautiful Soup, httplib2), Jinja2 templating, HTML/CSS/jQuery, and SQLAlchemy.

Website isn't live at the moment so here are some screenshots.
